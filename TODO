	TO DO
	
		The following tasks need to be done:
		
		* Use special stream for tracing without cluttering source.
		
		* Split into Pure Caller Handling and SMTP Handling.
		
		* If we split up into Request / Response, then we can can:
			- Package "QUIT THIS" into the response and get rid of the global variable "didNotQuit".
			- Split up SMTP processor into single COMMAND classes. 
		
		* We should use NIO API instead of one thread per connection.
		
		* Support TX inflow: In case of SMTP Exception, rollback endpoint TX.
		
		* SMTP as a class, SMTP Exception as a class.
		
		* Support more than one endpoint / thread per connection to allow
		  parallel processing of several incoming emails at one time.
		  Otherwise receiving the next mail in a connection must wait until
		  the MDB finished its (possibly lengthy) processing. 
		
		* Support more than one IP / Port combination to listen to.
		
		* Support POP3 polling.
		
		* Support IMAP4 pushing.
		
		* Support more than one endpoint.
